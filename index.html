			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				A 24 year old developer from the University of California, Irvine. Love to develop in my free time using a plethora of languages, frameworks, 
				and platforms. Some of my favorite languages are listed below:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C++ using the Qt framework or the Visual Studio C++ framework, knowledge extends into C++11</li>
				<li>Python 3 for small scripts such as web scrapers or one time fixes that can work on any OS</li>
				<li>Java for mobile development on Android using Android Studio</li>
				<li>C# for modern development including Windows WPF and Xamarin for mobile development along with Unity for simple game development</li>
				<li>Java/CSS/HTML5 for web development, prefer to write from scratch (like this github.io) but also know of a few Javascript frameworks</li>
				<li>Transact-SQL and PL/SQL (or plain ANSI SQL too) for writing stored procedures, functions, views, or general database querying</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The projects listed on this github are all done in my free time from work. These are mostly done to expand my knowledge in the language/framework. 
				Some do try and solve common issues faced by my colleagues and I that have no solution or a solution that is riddled with additional problems. 
				Below is a list of Github projects I have worked on.

			<h1>PoPi - The Screenshot Tool</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/eesandoval/PoPi">PoPi</a> is an application designed as a screenshot tool for the GNU/Linux operating system. 
				This application targets the X11 windowing 	system and was initially developed for KDE Plasma, 	but may work on any other X11 windowing system 
				regardless of desktop environment. Unlike many 	other screenshot tools available on GNU/Linux, this application is designed to mimic similar 
				functions to popular Window applications <a href="https://puush.me">puush</a> and <a href="https://getsharex.com">ShareX</a>. 
				These applications take a screenshot, save the screenshot image locally, upload the image to an image hosting site (such as 
				<a href="https://imgur.com">Imgur</a>), and finally copy the URL where the image was uploaded to onto the clipboard. This can all easily be 
				done in one simple hotkey motion on Windows using the aformentioned programs. Similar functionallity could be obtained in GNU/Linux using 
				other screenshot tools, however it was not as efficient as one simple hotkey and often involved multiple button clicks and user interfaces. 
				PoPi is designed to be simple enough to use and provide an easy way to auto-upload 	images to share them with others. This tool was developed 
				using <a href="https://www.qt.io">Qt 5.10</a> and is licensed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0</a>.
