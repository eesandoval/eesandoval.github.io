						Began my passion for development at the age of 12 by running a video game server for hundreds of players.
						Creating customized events for them while managing the large network traffic at the time to attract more players constantly kept me up at night 
						filled with joy when my users would experience smooth gameplay and fun events. Soon after began writing my own applications as a hobby. These 
						applications are to either test my knowledge in a new language or framework or provide a solution to a manual process that was tedious to my
						colleagues and I.

					<p>
						After informal years of development, I began study at the University of California Irvine under the Computer Science major as a Bachelor of Science.
						Professionally began my career after graduation in 2016 and have been in the industry since then. Enjoy writing programs from scratch but am capable 
						of utilizing a pre-existing standard library/framework when reinventing the wheel is too time-consuming. Additionally, have knowledge of a plethora
						of languages and frameworks, many of which can be found through GitHub as well as on this page.
